Snake ID app built on Django-photologue
=================

Take a closer look
------------------
- We have a `demo website <http://www.django-photologue.net/>`_.
- We also have some `examples of sites using Photologue 
  <https://github.com/jdriscoll/django-photologue/wiki/Examples-and-forks>`_ on the wiki.

Snake-related addenda
---------------------
Photologue has been altered a bit to allow ready authentication of images by experts.  Some photo-editing
features have been disabled as they aren't germane to the authentication task.
